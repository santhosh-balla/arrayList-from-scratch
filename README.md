This code defines a simple dynamic array class, ArrayList, which mimics the behavior of a vector or ArrayList found in other programming languages. The class supports adding and removing elements, as well as displaying the current elements in the array list. It manages memory dynamically, resizing the array as elements are added.

ArrayList Class: Contains an array of strings and methods to manipulate the array.
Constructor: Initializes the array with given elements.
Destructor: Cleans up the dynamically allocated memory.
addElement: Adds a new element to the end of the array, resizing it as needed.
removeElement: Removes an element at a specified index and shifts remaining elements.
displayElements: Prints all elements in the array.



Main Function:
Demonstrates creating an ArrayList object with initial elements, adding new elements, and displaying the contents of the array list.
